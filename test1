I HOPPED UNTIL THE COFFEE SHOP BUT I DECIDED TO BUY AN APPLE INSTEAD THEN MY PHONE STARTED RINGING
I REALIZED I LOVE BABIES AND CATS BUT I HATE ALL THE MICE IN MY HOUSE SO I STARTED SEARCHING ON MY LAPTOP
HOW CAN I ADOPT A DOG TO EAT ALL THE MICE AND THEN I CAME ACROSS TICKETS FOR THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
QUICKLY I BOOKED A TICKET TO NEW YORK

and here I am at school planning a trip to New York during my spring break with all my friends and I don't think they are prepared
for the mind blowing trip we are about to have in New York
